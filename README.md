Here are the all code and data I used.  
All the code is in the Jupyter Notebooks:  
 - 01 - GARCH Models Estimation.ipynb  
 - 02 - RNN-LSTM Model Estimation.ipynb  
 - 03 - Comparing Models.ipynb  
I also include pdf versions of the notebooks if you don't want to use Jupyter Notebook.  
I included the csv files I downloaded from Yahoo Finance.  
Feel free to download them from there if you want to check if they are real.  
In the zip file I saved the TensorFlow models. You have to unzip the file, for them to be loaded properly.
